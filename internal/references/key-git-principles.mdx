  Critical principles for contributing to and maintaining the Server State repositories

Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

## Be kind!

Yes, it sounds silly, but it's probably the most important principle of them
all. Open-Source contributions are, in 99 % of the cases, side-projects.
Open-Source is an excellent principle, and you can be proud to contribute to the
pool of open-source software. Don't use comments like "RTFM!" in this community.

Contributing to an open-source project is scary enough already: Your code is
available for the world to see (and judge). But you do need and should
appreciate these contributions. Therefore, if the best you can do is post some
discouraging comment about why something is "just bad", keep it to yourself!

Constructive criticism is appreciated, but you should always combine it with
explicit appreciation for the time the other person has taken.

:::caution

Online comments often get misinterpreted in the worst possible way (as it is,
unfortunately, also the safest way for the person receiving them).
Unfortunately, misunderstandings happen far sooner than you might think,
especially when they begin to cross cultures and languages. So please keep that
in mind when writing comments.

## Keep `main` instantly releasable

**Always** keep the state of the main branch releasable. As this project
implements automation in such a way that pre-configured tools automatically
release the correct kind of semantic release on the press of a button (which,
theoretically, anyone should be able to press). Pressing that button should
result in a good release whenever it gets pressed.

:::info

Keeping `main` instantly releasable enables this project to release changes in
no time, if needed or wanted

:::

## One branch per change

Don't try to put more than one kind of change (bug fix, feature, or anything
else) into a single branch, except if explicitly advised to do so by one of the
maintainers. Having one branch per change ensures the ability to correctly merge
it with a conventional commit message, should the need arise, and guarantees
correct generation of release notes and changelog in releases.

## Use the conventional commit commit-name system

The conventional commit system lets this project generate release notes and the
required semantic type of release at the push of a button without having to
think about it (sticking with the instantly releasable theme).

So don't worry if you might do something wrong. Even the "worst" of mistakes a
maintainer can fix. Either when merging your Pull Request (by squashing the
commits with a new commit message) or another way.

## Don't be afraid to ask

While everyone claims that JavaScript and Java are easy compared to other
languages (that may or may not be the case), what this project uses is a rather
complex and a large ecosystem with plenty of tooling.

While, at its core, it's still "easy old JS or Java," a lot might not be
apparent immediately. So always feel free to ask about anything. If someone
isn't kind in their response, they don't belong into this project, and in 99 %
of the cases, you'll get a kind reply from someone else.

Remember: You're not the first to feel this way (and even the most experienced
of developers sometimes have to ask someone else to find out they've forgotten
to hit **Compile** :wink:)
