  Overview of how we use the Redis key-value storage to store user data.

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Short description of what information this document provides: -->

We use a simple set of key-value pairs to store any individual user.

Any user has

- an id
- an email address
- a role (either `'user'` or `'admin'`)
- a password (saved as a hash)

ID, email and role are accessible under `_USERS/[id]/*` and the id can be
"reverse looked up" based on the email via `_USER_EMAILS/[email]`:

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/internal/redis-user-db-structure.drawio.svg"
	invertible
/>

This way, it's possible to perform all CRUD user operations with four Redis
commands:

- `SET [key] [value]` - set or add some values
- `GET [key]` - get some values
- `DEL [key]` - delete values
- `KEYS [pattern]` - lookup all keys that match the `[pattern]`

:::tip List of users

The only thing that may seem difficult with this key-value based storage, at
first, is listing all users. But we can easily achieve this using the `KEYS`
command:

```js
const raw = await references.redisConn.client.KEYS('_USERS/*/email');

const userIds = raw.map(s => s.split('/')[1]);
```
