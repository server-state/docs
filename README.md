This repository contains the documentation for Server State. It is available at
https://www.server-state.tech.

_Please note that this **does not** contain technical references for all Server
State components. For that, please refer to the individual READMEs and other
resources of the individual modules. Instead, this documentation focuses on more
general documentation of Server State and how to extend it._

## Writer's guide

You can find a guide for writers/contributors to the documentation at
`src/pages/writers-guide.mdx`, or, within the built website, at
`/writers-guide`.

Please familiarize yourself with these guidelines _before_ beginning to write
documentation for the project.

## Templates

The `_templates` folder has a few templates for the most common types of pages
you need to write to document the project.

These also include tips and tricks (as comments) as well as valuable snippets
relevant to this specific type of page (e.g., tutorial)

If you feel like any basic templates are lacking, please search through
[this repository's issues](https://github.com/server-state/docs/issues) for a
reference to this type of template. If you don't find any reference to it,
please feel free to open an issue for it yourself.
