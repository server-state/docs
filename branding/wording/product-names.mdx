<!--
Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Relevant imports: -->

import { Reference, Image } from '/components';

Products of the Server State organization get named in the pattern

> “Server State [product name]”

after first calling it by this full name, it’s possible to either abbreviate Server State to SerSta or drop the prefix all together:

> “SerSta [product name]”

> “[product name]”

We allow this when it’s clear from context that the product belongs to the Server State ecosystem.
