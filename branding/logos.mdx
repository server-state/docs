Guide
=====

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to explain how to work with a specific technology/concept.

=== When not to use this template:
When
- the article provides a quick explanation of a single concept (use a concept instead)
- the article should be a quick way to look things up (use a reference instead)
- the article focuses on how to solve a particular technical problem (use a tutorial instead)

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Guides are more comprehensive than many other article types.
  Feel free to add context and best practices.
- Mention common pitfalls and how not to use something (and why)

The Server State brand primarily uses shades of white and gray and one accent
color. Neutral colors symbolize the diversity of the ecosystem, which doesn't
lead in one direction but instead adapts to the client's servers:

## Server State Logos

:::caution Using the logos

Feel free to use the logos to link to Server State resources. First, however,
please follow these few simple guidelines:

- Do not distort the Logo
- Do not change the Logo's colors (if needed, you can use the monochrome
  version)
- Do not use the logos in any incriminating or discriminating manner

:::

### Color Logos

In most cases, you should use one of our colored logos:

<Grid>
	<div style={{ background: '#e3e3e3', color: '#232323', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>Light Backgrounds</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/color-light.svg" />
	</div>
	<div style={{ background: '#232323', color: '#e3e3e3', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>Dark Backgrounds</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/color-dark.svg" />
	</div>
</Grid>

### Monochrome Logos

Use the monochrome logos if the Server State Logo doesn't match your intended
color schema, but you still want to include the Logo.

<Grid>
	<div style={{ background: '#e3e3e3', color: '#232323', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>Light Backgrounds</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/monochrome-light.svg" />
	</div>
	<div style={{ background: '#232323', color: '#e3e3e3', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>Dark Backgrounds</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/monochrome-dark.svg" />
	</div>
</Grid>

### Stencil Logos

Use the stencil logos **if and only if the target medium doesn't support more
than two values**.

<Grid>
	<div style={{ background: '#e3e3e3', color: '#232323', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>Transparent</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/stencil-transparent.svg" />
	</div>
	<div style={{ background: '#232323', color: '#e3e3e3', padding: '1em' }}>
		<h3>White on black (WOB)</h3>
		<Image src="/branding/assets/logos/stencil-wob.svg" />
	</div>
</Grid>

## Logo design

Server State has three main types of logos:

- the brand (Server State) logo described above
- product logos, e.g., for the Web Client
- module logos for individual modules

There are requirements all these logos need to fulfill:

- they have to work in a square and a circle (and all in-between states)
- they have to work in multiple color environments:
  - Color (light and dark backgrounds)
  - Monochrome (light and dark backgrounds)
  - Stencil, i.e., in two values: "Black" and "White."

### The grid system

To keep sizing consistent throughout logos, we use a grid system when designing
them.

Since we create logos as vector files, absolute sizes aren't a good measure for
dimensions.

To get around this, we define our artboard as having the width and height x and
define all other units around that.

The basic shape of the Logo should get designed with a grid of 12 rows and
columns with no margin, i.e., each cell having the width and height `x/12`, to
add finer details, it's possible to later subdivide this into 24 sections with a
width/height of `x/24`:

<Grid>
	<div>
		<h4>Base grid with 12 rows and columns</h4>
		<Image alt="12 * 12 grid on a square with a circle marked" src="/static/branding/assets/logo-design/grid.svg" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>Subdivided grid with 24 rows and columns</h4>
		<Image alt="24 * 24 grid on a square with a circle marked" src="/static/branding/assets/logo-design/grid-subdivided.svg" />
	</div>

</Grid>

### Color usage

We want to create a good contrast with our logos. We use the colors White,
Light, Dark, and Black (cf. [Colors](./colors)) to achieve this. In addition, to
make the Logo recognizable as part of our brand, we add a small amount of the
Accent color.

### The outline

To add more contrast to the background within transparent logos, we add an
outline with a stroke width of `x/24` in a color that contrasts the presumed
background-color (i.e., Black for light backgrounds and White for dark
backgrounds) to the Logo's primary shape. This stroke, e.g., gets used in the
Server State logo, as you can see above.

### Template

To make the logo design process more accessible, we provide a template XD file
for creating Server State logos:
