Guide
=====

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to explain how to work with a specific technology/concept.

=== When not to use this template:
When
- the article provides a quick explanation of a single concept (use a concept instead)
- the article should be a quick way to look things up (use a reference instead)
- the article focuses on how to solve a particular technical problem (use a tutorial instead)

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Guides are more comprehensive than many other article types.
  Feel free to add context and best practices.
- Mention common pitfalls and how not to use something (and why)

The Server State brand primarily uses shades of white and gray and one accent
color. Neutral colors symbolize the diversity of the ecosystem, which doesn’t
lead in one direction but instead adapts to the client’s servers:
