<!--
Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
