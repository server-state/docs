Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with **TODO: REPLACE-ME**.

## What we'll build

Mollit sint aute voluptate qui consectetur consequat id laborum Lorem. Minim
reprehenderit qui minim in mollit excepteur tempor duis ut consequat. Deserunt
elit in eu consectetur aliquip esse sit elit culpa reprehenderit.

```java title='Car.java'
public class Car {
  public Engine engine;
  public int maxSpeed;
}
```

## Step 1: Create a new file

Aute aliqua reprehenderit occaecat esse excepteur sint in voluptate cillum ut
commodo magna cupidatat. To do so, create a file within your `src/main/java`
folder and call it `Car.java`.

## Step 2: Add the basic class declaration

In the new file, write the following code:

```java title='Car.java'
public class Car { }
```

## Step 3: Add an `engine` field to the `Car` class

Within our class declaration, we now add a new field called `engine`, which has
to implement the `interface Engine`:

```java title='Car.java' {2}
public class Car {
  public Engine engine;
}
```

Adding this field lets us define an object that implements this interface and
then access it within a car object.

## Step 4: Add a `maxSpeed` field to the `Car` class

Adding the field for the car's maximum speed (which is an integer) works the
same:

```java title='Car.java' {3}
public class Car {
  public Engine engine;
  public int maxSpeed;
}
```

:::tip Integers (`int`)

Integers are "whole" numbers that do not have any decimal places.
