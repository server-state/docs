  Consistent branch naming conventions make it easy to navigate through branches

Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

Following our branch naming convention helps to keep things consistent and also
encourages following the conventional commit method.

## Reading this document

:::tip Reading the EBNF grammar in this document

This document uses the EBNF language to describe a technical grammar for branch
names.

This is quite easy to read:

- `[]` = optional
- `{}` = repeat 0..n times
- `<>` = element defined somewhere else
- `"/"` = literal content `/` in the name
- `<a> | <b>` = either `<a>` or `<b>`

:::

## General Structure

Overall, your branch names should have the following structure:

```ebnf
<branch name> ::= [<branch ownership prefix>] <branch content> ;
```

## Branch owner prefix (optional)

If you intend to work on the branch all by yourself, it's valuable to "claim
ownership" within the branch name itself.

This both shows other contributors that they shouldn't work on this branch
without your permission and shows maintainers whom to contact about the contents
within the branch.

A branch ownership prefix consists of your GitHub username, followed by a `/`:

```ebnf
<branch ownership prefix> ::= <GitHub username> "/" ;
```

## Branch content

It's essential to, as short as possible, describe the content of the branch
(i.e., the changes it attempts to make).

Within the Server State Ecosystem, we recommend using one of two ways:

- an issue-based approach (cf. [Issue-based](#issue-based))
- a conventional commit-based approach (cf.
  [Conventional Commit based](#conventional-commit-based))

```ebnf
<branch content> ::= <issue-based> | <conventional-commit-based> ;
```

### Issue-based

If an issue already discusses the details of what your branch changes, you
should link to that issue within your branch name.

When you're working on an issue, please also make sure to assign yourself to the
issue. That way, other contributors can see that you're already working on this
issue.

```ebnf
<issue-based> ::= "issue-" <issue number> ;

<issue number> ::= <positive, whole number> ;
```

### Conventional Commit based

Alternatively, you can also describe the content directly in a "conventional
commit like" structure.

:::tip

Describing branch names in a way that's similar to conventional commits is
especially helpful as it already forces you to take on the "one change per
branch" conventional commit mindset.

:::

Instead of colons and scopes, we use slashes (`/`). Also, we don't care about
breaking changes within the branch name, yet.

Therefore, a conventional commit based branch description should be structured
like this:

```ebnf
<conventional-commit-based> ::= <conv-type> "/" [<conv-scope>] <description> ;

<conv-type> ::= "feat" | "fix" | "docs" | "chore" | "test" | "refactor" | "style" | "perf" ;
<conv-scope> ::= <scope-name> "/" ;
<description> ::= <valid-char> {<valid-char>} ;

<scope-name> ::= <valid-char> {<valid-char>} ;

<valid-char> ::= "a" | "b" | ... | "z" | "-" | "/" ;
```

where

- `<description>` describes the actual change (e.g., `add-send-function`)
- `<scope-name>` is a conventional commit scope present within the repository
  (cf. repo docs/guidelines for available scope names)

## Examples

Since EBNF can be a little bit ... abstract, let's take a look at a few
examples.

For the following examples, we assume that your username is `@githubuser`.

:::tip Example: Fixing a long-discussed issue

A change has been discussed in issue `#83` for quite a while. You're
contributing a fix on your branch.

```text
githubuser/issue-83
```

:::

:::tip Example: Working on an enormous change together

An extensive restructuring of the CLI is needed. This is too big to be discussed
in a single issue and instead covers multiple issues.

Multiple contributors are working on this branch.

```text
feat/cli/restructure-the-cli
```

:::

:::tip Example: A minor fix

You've spotted a bug in the CLI. Writing an extensive issue would cost you more
time than just quickly changing the line yourself.

You, therefore, omit opening an issue and instead commit the change immediately.

```text
githubuser/fix/cli/fix-args-parsing
```
