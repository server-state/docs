title: Conventional Commit Types
description: Quickly find out which conventional commit type you need to use.

<!--
Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Short description of what information this document provides: -->

This document gives you a quick way to determine the correct conventional commit
type for your change.

## Table

:::tip Multiple Commit Types

Use the most extensive type (the highest in the table below) if a commit
includes more than one commit type. Using the broadest type ensures correct
versioning. For example, if a feature, as a side-effect, also fixes a bug, it's
still a feature. If it closes an issue, please still include
`Closes: #issue-number` in the commit's footer to signify the fix

:::

:::info Breaking Changes

If a commit has breaking changes, you need to declare it using an exclamation
mark (`!`) before the colon (between the type and the colon (`:`), for example,
`fix!: Hello world`, or, if it exists, the scope and the colon, for example,
`feat(scope)!: Hello World`). With breaking changes, you should include a
`BREAKING CHANGE: [description]` footer describing the breaking change.
