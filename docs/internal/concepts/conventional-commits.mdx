Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

Conventional commits are a method of writing git commit messages in a
standardized format that also enables automatic determination of the next
release type in a semantic versioning system.

Conventional commits consist of a few primary elements:

- _type_: The type of the commit. The type can be one of a pre-configured number
  of elements, including (in this project) `feat` for features, `fix` for bug
  fixes, `docs` for documentation updates, `chore` for meta-stuff in the repo
  (not updating the packages), and some more.
- _scope_ (optional): The scope of the change, for example, the package name or
  something like `ci`
- _description_: a one-liner description of the type (feature, bug fix, or
  something else)
- _body_ (optional): more detailed descriptions
- _footer_ (optional): key-value-pairs of extra meta information, for example,
  fixed GitHub issues

All in all, the structure looks something like this:

```
<type>[(optional scope)][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footers]
```

## Examples

Since this doesn't look too intuitive, here are a few examples of actual commit
messages:

:::tip Example: A commit message for a bug fix introducing breaking changes

```
fix!: Fixed parameter conversion in `updateParents()`

Before, it automatically converted strings to numbers in such a
way that non-number inputs also got allowed. This is now changed.

Fixes: #8
BREAKING CHANGE: Non-number inputs no lead to `updateParents()` to
throw
```

:::

:::tip Example: A commit message for a feature in the package pkg-1

```
feat(pkg-1): Constructor for JSON parameter

added constructor for a JSON string as the single parameter
to `PackageOneClass`

Fixes: #22
