Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

## Components Overview

### Core Components

These components are "fixed", i.e., they cannot easily be adjusted. We keep them
as small as possible, moving as much functionality as possible into modular
components.

The Core Components include:

- the _Server_: The application that runs on your server. It's responsible for
  hosting necessary APIs as well as managing and running installed extensions
- the _Client_: A software running on your personal computer which provides a UI
  for interacting with the Server State Server. The "core" client, however, only
  manages connecting to the server and installing/uninstalling modular
  components, and is therefore pretty useless without having modular components
  installed.

### Modular Components

Modular components, on the other hand, are optional, installable, and often
interchangeable add-ons to the core components.

The modular components include:

- _Extensions_: Installable modules running on the _Server_ that can both extend
  the GraphQL-based API (e.g., for adding new parameters that you can monitor)
  and take over essential server-side tasks such as logging or notifying you
  about critical values.
- _Plugin_ (also: _Widget_): A plugin is, in some sense, to the _Client_ what an
  _Extension_ is to the _Server_. It extends the client with functionality.
  Usually, plugins add additional widgets for visualizing server parameters.
