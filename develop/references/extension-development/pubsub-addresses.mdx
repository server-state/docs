Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Short description of what information this document provides: -->

Server State extensions have access to various `publish`/`subscribe` methods to
trigger and listen for common occurrences within the Server State server.

Handling such events via a Pub/Sub system allows us to handle things like
logging with interchangeable plugins instead of attempting to find a "one size
fits all" solution that doesn't exist.

## Addresses

### Logging (`_LOG/`)

Logging resides within the `_LOG/*` address space.

As a payload, you can pass an array of any JSON-serializable value, but strings
are preferred, if possible.

#### `_LOG/DEBUG`

**Expected payload:** `JSONSerializable[]`

For logging debug messages.

#### `_LOG/INFO`

**Expected payload:** `JSONSerializable[]`

For logging informative messages.

#### `_LOG/WARN`

**Expected payload:** `JSONSerializable[]`

For logging warnings.

#### `_LOG/ERROR`

**Expected payload:** `JSONSerializable[]`

For logging error messages.

### Notifications (`_NOTIFY/`)

Notifying a user/admin about an occurance is a common task. Server State
provides a standardized interface so that users can configure Server State to
notify them via a platform of their choice.

:::tip Time-critical notifications

Every address within the notifications namespace `_NOTIFY` also has a "critical"
version with a `/critical` appendix.

"Critical" notifications should be seen as a sub-category, i.e., an extension
listening for all notifications should also include critical notifications.

Non-critical notifications don't require immediate attention and can, therefore,
be sent as a digest at a later time.

Critical notifications, on the other hand, should get sent to their target
audience as soon as possible.

:::

#### `_NOTIFY/general`

**Expected payload:** `string`

For notifying all users about an event. **Not for time-critical notifications!**

#### `_NOTIFY/general/critical`

**Expected payload:** `string`

Critical variant of [`_NOTIFY/general`](#_notifygeneral)

#### `_NOTIFY/admin`

**Expected payload:** `string`

For notifying admins about an event. **Not for time-critical notifications!**

#### `_NOTIFY/admin/critical`

**Expected payload:** `string`

Critical variant of [`_NOTIFY/admin`](#_notifyadmin)

## Custom Message Addresses

With a few exceptions, addresses are "open" to everyone.

Therefore, if your extension needs custom addresses, you can use any address
name, even if it's not pre-defined.

:::caution Reserved addresses

Your extension may not define its own `_`-prefixed addresses.

Apart from that, there are no "hard" restrictions.

:::

**To avoid address naming conflicts**, we strongly suggest prefixing
extension-specific addresses with `EXTENSIONID/`.

Thus, if, for example, your extension was `ABCDEF`, your address names should
match the following pattern:

```text title="Name pattern for plugin ABCDEF"
ABCDEF/*
```

:::info

We enforce this convention for officially recommended extensions.
